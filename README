Win32::Setupsup version {{$version}}, released {{$date}}


This module helps you to control other Windows programs.  It's
especially useful for programs that don't provide their own scripting
language or OLE Automation support.

The Win32::CtrlGUI module provides a more user-friendly wrapper around
Win32::Setupsup.  You should probably use it instead of trying to use
Win32::Setupsup directly.



INSTALLATION

The C++ part of Win32::Setupsup uses Microsoft's Structured Exception Handling,
which is not supported by MinGW's gcc.  Therefore, it does not work with
Strawberry Perl.  You need to compile Perl (and Win32::Setupsup) with
Microsoft's Visual C++.  Porting help is welcome.

To install this module type the following:

{{ $t->build_instructions }}



DEPENDENCIES

Requires Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, or Windows XP
