Win32-Setupsup version 1.02
===========================

This module helps you to control other Windows programs.  It's
especially useful for programs that don't provide their own scripting
language or OLE Automation support.

The Win32::CtrlGUI module provides a more user-friendly wrapper around
Win32::Setupsup.  You should probably use it instead of trying to use
Win32::Setupsup directly.

This release (by Christopher J. Madsen) simply repackages
Win32::Setupsup 1.01 to support the normal Makefile.PL method of
installation.  If you've already got version 1.01 installed, there's
no point in upgrading.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install


DEPENDENCIES

Requires Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, or Windows XP
