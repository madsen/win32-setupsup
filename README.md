Win32-Setupsup
==============

Win32-Setupsup is a Perl module that helps you to control other Windows programs.  It's especially useful for programs that don't provide their own scripting language or OLE Automation support.

This is a Git repository where development of Win32-Setupsup takes place.  For more information, visit [Win32-Setupsup on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Win32-Setupsup/).
